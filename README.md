## Configuration Details

The project is configured to use CRACO (Create React App Configuration Override) for customizing the default Create React App settings. This setup includes:

- Creating a `tsconfig.paths.json` file to manage TypeScript paths.
- Adding a `craco.config.js` file for CRACO configuration.
- Modifying the `tsconfig.json` file to reference the new path configurations.
- Updating `package.json` to use CRACO instead of react-scripts for running scripts.
